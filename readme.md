# Focus Rust 🛠️

As I am learning Rust, I am trying to create as many examples as I can. I am primarily learning Rust from the book 📚 but will also take a step back and watch some video tutorials when I feel the need for it.

### Just a Background on Myself 🎨

I started with C# in 2014, and after almost two years, began working with JavaScript. Since then, I have consistently worked with Node.js, engaging in various side projects as well as developing production-grade software with JavaScript. Additionally, in 2018, I started to learn Dart and Flutter for mobile cross-platform development.

In many cases, I will try to leverage my knowledge of C#, JavaScript, or Dart to facilitate the learning of Rust. Consequently, my implementations may not always adhere to best practices, which is not my intention for now. I am simply focused on learning and enjoying the beauty of Rust.

### What You'll Find in This Repository 📁

You will discover different branches dedicated to topics I find both interesting and challenging. Each branch is likely to contain various items corresponding to different chapters of the book.

Check out the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-01-defining-an-enum.html) for more information.
